# MY472 Formative: Exercise 1
1. Define a function with a single argument "data" that takes a dataset and performs some input transformation on it. 
The function should return the transformed dataset.
```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/MY472 - Data for Data Scientists/my472-formative")
library(tidyverse)
data(starwars)

# What is the mean height of humans by planet of birth? 

function_ex1 <- function(data) {
  data %>% 
  select(height, homeworld, species) %>% 
  filter(species == "Human") %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  group_by(homeworld) %>% 
  summarise(Mean_height = mean(height))
}
function_ex1(starwars)

```
